Hello there 👋,
  
  I'm Ahmad Syahmi, a student adores Science & Technology🔭. I hope to explore and learn more about this intricate world and (it's cliche) but make the world
  a better place with my knowledge and privallages :) I just graduated high school and I'm spending my summer break learning about Computer Science👨‍💻. I took
  Harvard's CS50 in the past few weeks which was a remarkable yet gratifying journey. At the moment, I'm eagerly waiting to take Andrew Ngs course on 
  Machine Learning which is coming out in June 2022, next mont on deeplearning.ai. Although, I sound like your average computer geek, I'm planning to pursue
  Aerospace Engineering✈️(despite everyone discouraging me to) as a degree because I want to contribute to reducing the impact of Aviation on climate change🌏
  and making flights more efficient. Besides that, I'm passionate about research in medicine🧬(to find cures to the worst of diseases), mitigating poverty
  (being in a developing country has shown me how much some of the people in my society stuggles) and education📚(everyone deserves a "world-class" education).
  I'm going to stuggle and face failures but im excited to see where this journey will take me :D 🌙
  
  It would be awesome to get to know you! So connect with me on Linkedin at : https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmad-syahmi-1089491a9/
